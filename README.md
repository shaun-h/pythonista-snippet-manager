#pythonista-snippet-manager
is a basic snippet manager for [pythonista for iOS](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/)

It has basic support for creating snippets, tagging coming soon. You can also create a new file from a snippet or copy the contents to the clipboard.

I have tested it on pythonista 2 it hasn't been tested on pythonista 3 yet.
